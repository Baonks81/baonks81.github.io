I'm not a programmer, but I could read flow-chart or coding. I've just used GNU/Linux as a normal operating system

### What I do
- I worked on ports grate/msm8916 kernel to other distros 
- I played BDM game, and I'm DURA guild master
- I've researching around like Neo, whom could find Morpheus out on matrix
- I read some documents on internet, even postmarketOS, Linux mainline kenel documents

### Contact
- Matrix: `#offtopic:postmarketos.org` (ping @baonks81:matrix.org)
