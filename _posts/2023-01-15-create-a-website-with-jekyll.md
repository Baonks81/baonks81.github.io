When I was online, I saw some github.io website. I just note that but I was still curious how to create webpage. I found jekyll, a tool to create static web, so I used it for my blog.
My journey has just begun but so many things which I learn from open-source.

At the beginning, I start bought 1 Nexus 7 2012 16GB from my friend in 2018. But it's still slow at that time.
I didn't optimize it, especial Android. I installed Ubuntu 13.04 Raring Ringtail on it, but it's still unsuable.
So I searched around on web, I found those using kernel 3.1.10 and no one care about unstable. Someone made Nexus 7 run on kernel 3.4 Unlegacy Android but no documents.
I decided left it there, untill 2020, I saw someone testing grouper kernel on princeton repo with apk package, I don't know how to using it too
and I saw Oliver Smith started postmarketOS, and David Heidelberg took ports mainline kernel 5.8 to grouper and tilapia
The new GNU/Linux mainline open, I followed the guide and install pmOS (Alpinelinux) running on grouper, now it's using kernel 6.1. And Clamor, digetx and more people worked on it to run U-boot, and pure Linux

I saw lot of websites run on github.io. I found [jekyll] tool, and more documents to help me creating static blog.
And this is basic when you need startover a blog, I get free template at [startbootstrap] and [formspree]
