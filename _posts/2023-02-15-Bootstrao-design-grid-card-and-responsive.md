When I created my personal blog from basic barebone jekyll, and slowly upgraded the clean-blog template. And then the requirement is how to display the home page and link the pages. I re-design those

{% include image.html
            img="images/Bootstrap-600x345.png"
            title="Bootstrap framework"
            caption="Bootstrap design and responsive website" 
            url="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components/card/" %}

Luckily, clean-blog is coding from the bootstrap framework, a framework known for creating responsive website components very quickly. It is only difficult to edit the display of the website according to the programmer's discretion. I used grid cards, combined borders and horizontal/vertizontal card transitions, padding, gutters elements to create a homepage that looks almost like an image galery.

Bootstrap is really a powerful framework for people who don't want to spend too much time manually responsive for each screen size for the frontend.
