When I want to write an image slideshow for card on bootstrap-css-jekyll. You just need to think a little about how to assemble the available code for card demonstrations on YouTube, adjust the css to match the theme's structure, that's a quick way to create a personal blog, it's a better way than setting up website and designing new layout.

{% include image.html
            img="images/jekyll-bootstrap.jpg"
            title="CSS on Bootstrap framework and jekyll"
            caption="CSS on Bootstrap framework and jekyll" %}

There are many ways to adjust a layout, as you can see on YouTube below, adjusting the css makes the movement go in a different direction, accidentally it becomes a new tweak compared to the original instructions of the video author.

{% include youtube.html id='3RvQJX1_fKQ' %}
