When I created my personal blog from basic barebone jekyll, and slowly upgraded the clean-blog template. And then the requirement is how to display the home page and link the pages.

Luckily, clean-blog is coded from the bootstrap framework, a framework known for creating responsive and responsive website components very quickly. It is only difficult to edit the display of the website according to the programmer's discretion. I applied grid cards, combined borders and horizontal/vertizontal card transitions, padding elements, gutters to create a homepage that looks almost like an image galery.

Bootstrap is really a powerful framework for people who don't want to spend too much time manually responding to each screen size for the frontend.
